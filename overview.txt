How to pull, edit and push repo to github:
1. Create and switch to a new branch locally
    git switch -c new_branch_name
2. Pull (combination of fetch and merge (to local branch)) from remote repo (Github) 
    git pull origin main
3. Stage files (if necessary)
    git add filename
4. Commit staged files 
    git commit -m "Add commit message here" 
    git commit -a -m "Add commit message here" (If want to skip stagimg process)
5. Push to remote repo 
    git push origin main
6. Create a pull request on Github
    Github will handle merging branches in remote repo
