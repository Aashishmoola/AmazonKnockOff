General styling guidelines
    1. Always write hardcoded constants in CAPS to dintinguish form codeActionsOnSave
    2. When refrerring to react components, must capitalise component name, else starts with lowercase
        Ex: productData ( data relating to product), Product (Component), ProductPropsType(Type to check props in Product) 
    

Common coding Errors
    1. UseState is used only when a rerendering of dispayed components is needed
    2. UseEffect is only intended for handling SideEffects (data fetching, data logging)
